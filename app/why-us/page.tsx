                  LPG is a very safe and reliable source of energy, that can be
                  used for cooking and heating. LPG has many advantages, to name
                  a few:

                <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-3">Efficient</h4>
                <p className="text-sm">
                  It can be up to five times more efficient than traditional
                  fuels, resulting in less energy wastage and better use of our
                  planetâ€™s resources.
                </p>
                <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-3">
                  Portable & Accessible
                </h4>
                <p className="text-sm">
                  LPG is extremely versatile and portable. It can be transported
                  using sea, rail or road transport. LPG can be accessible to
                  everyone everywhere today without major infrastructure
                  investment.
                </p>
                <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-3">Clean</h4>
                <p className="text-sm">
                  LPG is a clean burning fuel that is low carbon, emits
                  virtually no black carbon and does not spill. Do you know that
                  South Africa is amongst the most polluted countries in the
                  world, this mainly due to the fact that electricity is still
                  being generated through the use of coal. So it is time for us
                  to act accordingly and reduce the CO2 footprint!

                Africa. For safety and quality purposes of the installation work
                performed, the installation must be checked to be compliant with
                current rules and regulation. Therefore, after every
                installation a CoC (Certificate of Compliance) will be signed
                off between installer as well as you as our client.
